# DigitalControlAndAutomation

This is a college project, of Control and automation class, in this work my team has made a PID control, which the subject control the angular speed of a motor, this motor are suplied from a MOSFET transistor and the sensor to make the feedback information is a enconder with 2 photodiodes.
In this case was utilized a scanner motor driver CB605-60043, which have 6 pin to use, and those pins have the these configuration:

A: motor GND
B: motor +12V
C: GND
D: +5Vcc
E: Fisrt photodiode out
F: second photodiode out
